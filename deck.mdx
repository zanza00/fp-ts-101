# Intro to Fp(-ts)

---

## FP has two main thing

- Referential trasparency
- Composition (as a design pattern)

---

## Referential transparency

- everything is an expression
- you can replace an expression with its value without changing the program's behavior

---

## Composition

- small little Functions that can be combined to have a more complex program
- we can combine these functon to have even more complex program

---

# Lets introduce fp-ts

```
npm i fp-ts
```

---

# Option

`Option<A>` is a container for an optional value of type A.

- If the value is there, we have an instance of `Some<A>`
- If the value is not there, we have an instance of `None`.

---

## Get the first element

```ts
// get the first element
function head<A>(arr: Array<A>): Option<A> {
  return arr.length > 0 ? some(arr[0]) : none;
}

const example1: Option<number> = pipe(
head([1, 2]),
map(n => n + 100),
); // some(101)
```

---

# Either
