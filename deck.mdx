# Intro to Fp(-ts)

---

## Functional Programming has two main thing

- Referential trasparency
- Composition (as a design pattern)

---

## Referential transparency

- everything is an expression
- you can replace an expression with its value without changing the program's behavior

---

## Composition

- small little Functions that can be combined to have a more complex program
- we can combine these functon to have even more complex program

---

# Lets introduce fp-ts

```
npm i fp-ts
```

---

# Option

`Option(A)` is a container for an optional value of type A.

- If the value is there, we have an instance of `Some(A)>`
- If the value is not there, we have an instance of `None`.
